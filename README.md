# DistCB

Our code for the DistCB contextual bandits experiments, as part of https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15703. 

DistCB.py contains the functions that carry out the experiment iterations. king_housing_preprocess.py and prudential_preprocess.py are used to preprocess the King County Housing and Prudential Life Insurance datasets respectively.
